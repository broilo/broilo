    My name is Mateus, but my friends used to call me Manteiga (which means butter) because I cried too much when I was just a kid. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, I'm a Physicist by definition but I was feeling a bit bored with it and that's the reason why (at least one of many) I decided to change topics to Data Science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was Forged under Fortran's careful eyes!
  </p>
  <p>
    I really like working in cross-functional teams with people smarter than me and I'm always seeking the One Question that shapes everything.
  </p>
  <p>  
    Glad to learn new things every day!

  <p>
    Even today every morning I still take a look at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/new">High Energy Physics Phenomenology</a> section in arXiv, just to see how what's going on around there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Very recently I developed a sudden interest in Casual Inference (my main focus for now). For the time being I'm trying to find a way to connect it in the project that I'm involved with at Indra. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides DS, Machine Learning and Physics, I really like to study Finance, but nothing too deep, just as a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love to learn different types of methods and approaches to solve the same problem. I feel that's pretty much the logic underneath the hood of coding.

## Papers & Projects

[Academic: Undergrad-MSc-PhD Thesis and Peer-Reviewed Published Papers](https://github.com/broilo/Academic)
<br>
  In this repository you'll find all my scientific publisehd works (mostly associated with Physics). Moreover, [HEP-Inspires](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=find%20a%20m%20broilo) shows some stats related to my papers.
</br>
  
[Post-Doctorate projects](https://github.com/broilo/PD-projects)
<br>
  Finishied and closed PD-project in High-Energy Physics.
</br>

[UFC fighter card info](https://github.com/broilo/UFC-project)
<br>
**Project**:
<br>
  The aim was to recognize the fighter by means of an input image. This was a computer vision project, more precisely a face recognition and identification, using transfer learning, MTCNN (and OpenCV). The MVP was deployed in AWS (using EC2 as server and S3 as bucket).
