    My name is Mateus, but my friends used to call me Manteiga (which means butter) because I cried too much when I was just a kid. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, I'm a Physicist by definition but I was feeling a bit bored with it and that's the reason why (at least one of many) I decided to change topics to Data Science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was Forged under Fortran's careful eyes!
  </p>
  <p>
    I really like working in cross-functional teams with people smarter than me and I'm always seeking the One Question that shapes everything.
  </p>
  <p>  
    Glad to learn new things every day!

    Even today every morning I still take a look at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/new">High Energy Physics Phenomenology</a> section in arXiv, just to see how what's going on around there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Very recently I developed a sudden interest in Casual Inference (my main focus for now). For the time being I'm trying to find a way to connect it in the project that I'm involved with at Indra. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides DS, Machine Learning and Physics, I really like to study Finance, but nothing too deep, just as a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love to learn different types of methods and approaches to solve the same problem. I feel that's pretty much the logic underneath the hood of coding.
